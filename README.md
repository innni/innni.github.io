# UTube: A Polymer + Youtube Data API Demo

UTube lets you search and save your results. You can browse the results again at a later time and remove videos you don't want to keep.

Please note that this is my *very first* Polymer project and I spent most of my time digging polymer documentations. I welcome any feedback. 

## Project Features / Dev Stack

 -    Search youtube and save search results under the keyword.
 -    Manage search results (Delete Lists, Delete Videos for now)
 -    HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bower
 -    Polymer: To reap the benefits of Google Material through Polymer paper and core elements, which also meant making a "bold" decision of working with an unfamiliar, badly documented framework. It could have led to a rabbit hole. Thankfully, it didn't. I found myself working late at night but getting to know polymer is well worth the efforts.
 
## Project Setup

 -   `git clone https://github.com/innni/innni.github.io.git`
 -   `cd innni.github.io/demo/poly-tube`
 -   `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
 
## If I had the time, the app would...

 -   return more results by make use of pagination.
 -   allow user to pick and save videos on the main page apart from the current "Save All" option.
 -   use Firebase instead of localStorage and offer an auth system.
 -   allow user to edit the title of saved results
 -   have a better organized structure and an automated frontend work flow with SASS compilers, JS + CSS + Image minifiers and a Web Component concatenation tool like Vulcanize to optimize for production.
 -   be certified to work on major browsers and platforms after extensive crowss-browser and platform tests.
 
## If I had even more time, the app would...
  -   allow user to edit the title of saved results, merge results, tag results, categorize results, share results, add videos manually to a list, filter videos based on different attributes, clone lists...
